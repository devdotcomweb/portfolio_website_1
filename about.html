<!-- <h1>About Me</h1>

          <div class="question question-2">
            <h3>How did I learn to code?</h3>
            <p>
              The way I learn the most is by first learning the material by
              listening to the course and taking notes. Then I print code for a
              simple project. I am trying to understand this code. I reach for
              the documentation. Finally, I try to rewrite this code myself.
              Usually I am not able to do it the first time. But in the second
              and third time it is possible
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="question question-3">
            <h3>What am I working on now?</h3>
            <p>
              It's likely that as you read it, I'm learning next.js and maybe
              even writing projects. I am familiar with this framework and I
              like it very much because it is elegant and not overcomplicated.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="question question-4">
            <h3>Why do I want to become a web developer?</h3>
            <p>
              The longer I learn to code, the more I like doing it. Each
              completed project gives me a lot of satisfaction. I like to learn
              new things at work and thus develop myself and thus have a
              positive impact on the company in which I work.
