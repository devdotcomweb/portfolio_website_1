                    <h3>Why did I start learning to code?</h3>
                    <p>Challenges give me the most motivation. The beginning of learning was a real challenge because I couldn't find anyone amongst my friends who knows about coding, I did and do everything myself. I experimented a lot with different instructors and teaching methods until I found what suits me.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="question question-2">
                    <h3>How did I learn to code?</h3>
                    <p>The way I learn the most is by first learning the material by listening to the course and taking notes. Then I print code for a simple project. I am trying to understand this code. I reach for the documentation. Finally, I try to rewrite this code myself. Usually I am not able to do it the first time. But in the second and third time it is possible</p>
                </div>
                <div class="question question-3">
                    <h3>What am I working on now?</h3>
                    <p>It's likely that as you read, I'm learning next.js and maybe even writing projects. I am familiar with this framework and I like it very much because it is elegant and relatively easy to learn.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="question question-4">
                    <h3>Why do I want to become a web developer?</h3>
                    <p>The longer I learn to code, the more I like doing it. Each completed project gives me a lot of satisfaction. I like to learn new things at work and thus develop myself and thus have a positive impact on the company in which I work.</p>
